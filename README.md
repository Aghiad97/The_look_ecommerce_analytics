##  Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Looker e-commerce public dataset**, focusing on:

- Customer behavior and segmentation
- Product performance and profitability
- Strategic insights for marketing, inventory, and retention

The project simulates a **real-world analytics scenario** to demonstrate my skills in SQL, data exploration, business intelligence reporting, and stakeholder communication.

### 🔹 **Products Report**

- Determine top-grossing and low-performing products
- Evaluate product lifespan, recency, and average monthly contribution
- Classify products into performance tiers based on total revenue
- Highlight product categories with highest gross profit and AOV

## 📈 Key Insights

###  Customer Insights

- **74.4% churned users** (no orders in 6+ months) – urgent need for retention strategy
- **50+ age group** leads in total spend and average monthly spend
- **Search** is the top marketing channel ($7.58M revenue), followed by Organic and Facebook
- **China, US, and Brazil** are the top 3 user markets

>  **Actionable Strategy:** Re-engagement campaigns, optimize for mature segments, expand organic & social marketing reach

###  Product Insights

- **Outerwear & Jeans** dominate gross profit categories
- **Top 10 products** (e.g., Canada Goose Jackets) generate disproportionately high gross profit
- **Low-performance products** make up 98%+ of customer orders—huge upselling opportunity
- **208-month recency** for some products indicates stale inventory

>  **Actionable Strategy:** Liquidate inactive SKUs, promote high-AOV products, tailor marketing to proven profitable items
