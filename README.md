## 📈 Key Insights

### 👥 Customer Insights

- **74.4% churned users** (no orders in 6+ months) – urgent need for retention strategy
- **50+ age group** leads in total spend and average monthly spend
- **Search** is the top marketing channel ($7.58M revenue), followed by Organic and Facebook
- **China, US, and Brazil** are the top 3 user markets

> 🔁 **Actionable Strategy:** Re-engagement campaigns, optimize for mature segments, expand organic & social marketing reach

### 📦 Product Insights

- **Outerwear & Jeans** dominate gross profit categories
- **Top 10 products** (e.g., Canada Goose Jackets) generate disproportionately high gross profit
- **Low-performance products** make up 98%+ of customer orders—huge upselling opportunity
